      This is <strong>Geo</strong>! My curiosity to better understand the world
      around me has led me to study science and technology. Now, I am grateful
      that I have turned my <strong>passion into a career</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I help enterprises build data-driven solutions that improve their daily
      operations. My main focus has been building software that ensures data is
      transferred and stored <strong>securely, efficiently, and reliably</strong
      >. Along the way, I have developed a strong passion for the DevOps
      culture. I believe its principles are essential for creating robust and
      scalable systems, especially in this era of cloud computing.
    </p>

      However, my interests go beyond the technical aspects of software
      development. I am especially interested in how Artificial Intelligence can
      be applied to solve medical and health problems. The <strong
        >intersection of biology and technology</strong
      >
      is a field that I believe will have a profound impact on the future.

      Outside work, you will find me practicing all kinds of sports, like
      running, climbing or tennis. I also love reading about science,
      particularly about the mistery of physics and the universe. Of course, as
      a
      <strong>curiosity-driven person</strong>, I enjoy traveling and
      discovering new places and cultures.
