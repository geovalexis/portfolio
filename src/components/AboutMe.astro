      This is <strong>Geo</strong>! My curiosity to understand the world around me led me study
      science and technology. Now I am grateful I could turn my <strong
        >passion into a career.

      I help enterprises build data-driven solutions that improve their daily
      operations. My main focus in this journey is building software that
      ensures <strong
        >data is transferred and stored securely, efficiently, and reliably.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a strong advocate of the DevOps culture, which I believe is the key
      to build robust and scalable systems, especially in this cloud computing
      era.

      Though, my interests go beyond the technical aspects of software
      development. I am specially interested in how Artificial Intelligence can
      be applied to solve medical and health problems. The <strong
        >intersection of biology and technology</strong
      > is a field I believe will have a profound impact in the future.

      Outside work, you will find me practicing all kind of sports, like
      running, climbing or tennis. I also love reading about science, in
      particular about the mistery of physics and the universe. Of course, as a
      <strong>curiosity-driven person</strong>, I enjoy traveling and discovering new places and
      cultures.
